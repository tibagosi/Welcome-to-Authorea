\item Domain ontology
The domain ontology captures the domain of Urban Search and Rescue.
\item HL - Situation awareness, human perspective
\item User model
\item Teamwork model
From the team perspective every actor (human or robot) in the mission is a team member with a specific role, activity status, a set of capabilities, and a list of assigned tasks. Some properties will be clearly human-specific: level of cognitive overload, physical tiredness, etc., and some robot-specific: battery level, . But from the team perspective they are viewed as equal, with different and varying properties.
