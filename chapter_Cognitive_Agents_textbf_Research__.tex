\chapter{Cognitive Agents}

\textbf{Research question:} How to create agents using ontological technology for their knowledge representation, such that they 

Cognitive agents, by the definition of (cite) are pieces of software that perceive and act on an environment. Agents play a very important role in our project, namely, they represent each actor of the real world rescue team in a multi-agent system. The management of the high-level information between the high-level database and the visual interface is done by each agent, depending on the actor it represents. Hence, agents 

\section{GOAL agent programming framework}

The GOAL agent programming framework (cite) was introduced by (cite), and represents today a powerful tool for agent development. It is a Java-based program with its own GOAL language for agent definition and basic program constructs (if rules, for loops, message, percept and goal operators). 
In GOAL, a multi-agent system consists of agents that get percepts from an environment, perform actions on it, and send messages between each other. Each agent is defined by a set bases: a knowledge, a belief, a percept, a message and a goal base. Described more in detail here (cite).
At the current state, it had support for Prolog as a Knowledge Representation Technology for agents. 
As the project requires ontologies to be the way of representing knowledge, agents are now faced with the problem of using ontology technologies for KR purposes. This introduced the need for a change: instead of hard-wiring now ontology technologies into GOAL, a better, more generic approach was taken to be able to plug in from now on any KR technology for the use of agents. As discussed more in detail in the paper (cite), the generic KR Interface was created and used for this purpose.

\section{KR Interface}

The KR Interface is a generic interface for cognitive agents to be able to use any KRT (under some basic assumptions) for representing the agents' knowledge. 


\section{OWL mental state}

The mental state is (explanation).
OWL mental state concept and implementation.

\section{OWL agents}

Finally, an OWL agent then can do this,this,this, explain how they are different / better/ worse than Prolog agents. How they serve the TRADR project or any other application purpose. 
Plan: full comparison with Prolog agents, speed test, expressivity, features available, etc.

\section{Semantic web for agents}

Since ontological technologies that we used here allows us to reach out to the Semantic Web,
(in the future), agents will be available
