\section{Smart Visualization - Display Logic}

\textbf{Research question:} What is the best way of providing information to the user in order to achieve joint situation awareness? 

The previously discussed agents' role in realizing the display logic and hence the situational awareness.

\subsection{Joint situation awareness}

When is it achieved, how is it achieved,

\subsection{Visualization techniques}

The rules that govern what to show to whom (and when) based on what is the scenario/ current happening and the user (role, task, current status, etc.) 

  
\textbf{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item A set of features or attributes that define or affect the display logic: what dictates what type of information is displayed (channeled) to whom (when, how). 
\item A part of the ontology related to or part of User modeling that captures these features.
\item A set of rules (encoded in the agent's knowledge) that determine the agent's behavior responsible for the display logic. 
\end{itemize}
